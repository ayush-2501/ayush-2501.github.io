  desc: Hello there, Welcome to my portfolio! I am a computer science graduate student at California State University, Fullerton. I am interested by artificial intelligence and would be pleased to collaborate with you on any exciting project. As an Intern, I gained a year of professional Data Analyst experience in the firm. Academically, I prefer to undertake research to study and validate new ideas. Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayushpradhan2501/">Linkedin</a> if you want to discuss my work. In my leisure time, I like to swim and listen to music.
